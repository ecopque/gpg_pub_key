# Edson's GPG Pub Key Repository

This repository contains essential data for sending encrypted files to me.

- Get my GPG public key: Download the "ecop_sendfile_publickey.asc" file to obtain my GPG public key.
- Send encrypted files: Use this key to encrypt files and send them over any channel of your choice.
- About the key: This key was generated on a computer with internet access.

Notes: If you, like me, do not trust the Signal Messenger service completely, you can send me the encrypted file through this channel.
